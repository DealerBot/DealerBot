# Privacy Policy

## Last Updated: 15 March, 2025

### 1. Information We Collect

DealerBot collects and stores specific Discord-related data to provide its services efficiently and prevent abuse. This includes:
- Guild, User, and Channel Identifiers: Stored as unique Discord-generated snowflakes to facilitate bot functionality via Discord’s API. These do not constitute personal user data and may not be subject to deletion requests.
- Guild Invites: Stored to enable certain bot features. Server administrators can request the removal of stored invites by contacting support.
- Message Content (Temporary Cache): Messages are temporarily cached in memory to support features like the snipe command. However, DealerBot does not store full message content on disk unless necessary for debugging.

### 2. User Control Over Data
- Users can disable message caching for the snipe command by running /snipetoggle.

### 3. Data Storage and Security

All data collected by DealerBot is securely stored on the hosting provider’s servers. Only the bot owner(s) and the hosting provider have access to this data.
- Backups: Periodic backups are taken to prevent data loss.
- Third-Party Services: Some bot functions may rely on third-party services, and while we strive to ensure security, we cannot guarantee where third-party services store data.

### 4. Purpose of Data Collection

DealerBot only collects and retains data necessary for service functionality and improvement. We do not sell, share, or distribute user data under any circumstances.

### 5. Data Retention
- Guild Data: Deleted automatically when the bot is removed from a server.
- Cached Data: Cleared periodically or upon bot restarts.
- Guild Invites: Stored until an admin requests their removal via our support channels.

### 6. Requesting Data Deletion

Users and server administrators can request data removal by contacting our support team via the Support Server https://discord.gg/dealer .

### 7. Policy Changes

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect legal or service changes. Continued use of DealerBot after an update implies acceptance of the revised policy. If you disagree with any changes, you should discontinue use and request data removal.
